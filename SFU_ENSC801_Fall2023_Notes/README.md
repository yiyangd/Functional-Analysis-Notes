R^3 = 3D Euclidean

d/dx f points in the deri of greateset increase

eg. $f(x) = (x-5)^2$

gradient descent: to get to the minimum of a function in arbitrary domain $R^n$,

x |-> x - \alpha d/dx f = x - \alpha f(X)

estimate of minimum - location of lowest value


convex function - one and only one global minimum 

WHat is the

$\bigtriangledown f$ = total rate of change of f

$\bigtriangledown f$(x) = gradient of f at a location x points in direction of greatest increase

What is rate of change of f along vector v along the unit direction  \hat{v} = \frac{v}{||v||}

$\bigtriangledown f^t \cdot v = [] [] $
1 xn n x 1 = 1 x 1

= $v^t \cdot \nabla f$

### Taylor Series (18:39)
$$f(x+h) = f(x) + f'(x) + f''(x)$$

#### 2D function $f(x_1, x_2)$

$$f(x_1+h_1, x_2, h_2) = f (x_1,x_2) + f'(x_1, x_2)$$


#### Newton Law's 
$$s = ut + 1/2 at^2 taylar series$$
